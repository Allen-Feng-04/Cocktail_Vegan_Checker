**Vegan Cocktail Checker**

**1. Data Feature Overview:**
For vegans and those who are curious, this tool allows you to check whether your favorite cocktail is vegan-friendly. The feature collects a list of ingredients from the cocktail you specify and checks whether each ingredient is vegan or not using a combination of APIs. If one or more ingredients are not vegan, the cocktail will be marked as non-vegan. If all ingredients are vegan, you can enjoy your cocktail with peace of mind.

**2. APIs Used:**
TheCocktailDB API:
URL: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php
Purpose: Fetches the list of ingredients from your favorite cocktail.
Why Chosen: It has a vast database of cocktails and their ingredients, making it easy to retrieve mixed drink recipes.

Edamam Nutrition API:
URL: https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-nutrition-api
Purpose: Checks the nutritional information of each ingredient and determines whether it is vegan.
Why Chosen: The Edamam API provides detailed ingredient analysis, including health labels (e.g., vegan, gluten-free), which allows us to determine the vegan status of each ingredient.
